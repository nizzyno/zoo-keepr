const router = require('express').Router();

module.exports = router;

/* Here we're employing Router as before, but this time we're having 
it use the module exported from animalRoutes.js. (Note that the .js extension 
    is implied when supplying file names in require()).

Doing it this way, we're using apiRoutes/index.js as a central hub for all 
routing functions we may want to add to the application. It may seem like overkill 
with just one exported module, but as your application evolves, it will become a very 
efficient mechanism for managing your routing code and keeping it modularized. */
